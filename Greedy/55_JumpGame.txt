Notes:
- Trick is to start from the back and update the goal aka the end that we need to reach
- if we can reach the goal from the current index, set that to be the new goal and continue

Steps:
- keep a variable goal_index
- for loop through the nums array in reverse
    - if we can reach the goal from current index
        - set goal to current_index

- if goal is 0 return True (aka we can make it to the end), else return False


def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        
    goal_index = len(nums) - 1

    for i in range(len(nums) -1, -1, -1):
        if i + nums[i] >= goal_index:
            goal_index = i
        
    return goal_index == 0
