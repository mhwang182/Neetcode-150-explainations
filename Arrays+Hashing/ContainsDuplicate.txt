Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true

Steps: 
- create a Set.
    - new_set = Set() (in python)
    - use Set and not Hashmap because we just need to check if a number was seen before not count number of occurances
- iterate through array
- for each number check if the number is in the Set.
    - if so return True because a duplicate is found
    - else add the number to the Set
return False if no duplicates found
