Notes:
    - We want to look into the future so we should iterate through the list backwards

    - Think of the stack as a list of all the higher temperatures

    - Keep in mind that if anything before the current temp is greater than the current, 
      then anything in the stack that is less than the current is useless.
      Therefore anything less than the current should be popped until we find something greater than
    
Steps:
    - initialize a stack
    - initialize result list of 0's

    - iterate through the temperature list backwards
        - if the stack is empty
            - set result of that index to 0
            - push index to the stack
        - else
            - while the stack isnt empty and the top of stack is less than or equal to the temp at current index
                - pop from the stack (aka these temperatures are useless)
            
            - if stack is empty set result of index to 0 and push index to stack
            - if stack not empty
                - result is index at back of stack - current index
            
            - push current index to the top of stack

def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    stack = []
    result = [0] * len(temperatures)

    for i in range(len(temperatures) - 1, -1, -1):
        if(not stack):
            result[i] = 0
            stack.append(i)
        else:
            while stack and (temperatures[stack[-1]] <= temperatures[i]):
                stack.pop()
            if(not stack):
                result[i] = 0
            else:
                result[i] = stack[-1] - i
            stack.append(i)

    return result
