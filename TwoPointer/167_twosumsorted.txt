Notes:
- Read carefully, the array is 1 indexed

Steps:
- initialize left and right pointers at 0 and start
- while left < right
    - calculate sum of left + right 
    - if sum less than target, left += 1
    - if sum is greater than target, right -= 1
    - if sum equals target, return [left + 1, right + 1]  (remmeber array is 1 indexed)
