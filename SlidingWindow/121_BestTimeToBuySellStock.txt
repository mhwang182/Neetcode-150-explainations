Notes:
- Approach is to keep track of the current min price and current max profit
- iterate through the list
    - If the current price is greater than the current min, then consider its profit
    - else, then update the min price and continue


def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    profit = 0
    min_price = prices[0]
    for i in range(1, len(prices)):
        if prices[i] > min_price:
            profit = max(profit, prices[i] - min_price)
        else:
            min_price = prices[i]
    
    return profit
